# Atala Community Maintained projects
This is an open-source community maintained organisation where individuals can come together to develop cool features on top of the atala-prism-wallet-sdk, self sovereign identity, didcomm and anoncreds.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Currently maintained by @elribonazo, @mixmix

## üë©‚Äçüíª Projects
### Edge Agent SDK demos
We have created several demos using the atala Identity SDK to create sample implementations with each pluto-encrypted storage available, indexDB, inMemory, levelDB, in nodejs, browser and electron environments.

### Pluto Encrypted
Is a community maintained project which aims to bring a scalable and future proof storage solution for Wallet SDK on typescript. By using this package you can ensure that this dependency will fit the AtalaPrism wallet SDK contract and provide the SDK with storage finally.
This package is compatible with Atala Prism Wallet SDK v3.2.0

We currently support database wrappers for IndexDB, InMemory and are working together to bring you level-db with electron compatibility. We are not going to stop here but ensure that our SDK can be used in any platform and language.
